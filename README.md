# Siri-WhatsApp 👩

Automatic WhatsApp message sender using Siri 

For the romantic💞 female voice of Siri, I have imported a python library **pyttsx3** - (Python text to speech)  

🤓 To recognize the voice input from us (me)  **speech_recognition** module is introduced.   

Eventually to send the ✍ WhatsApp message **PyWhatKit** python library is initiated. 

## How it functions?

- Siri brings up 🙋‍♀️ herself asks for any support from her side.
- User - (Requests to send message to the person)
- Siri begins again her question 👩‍🏫 "To whom you need to send the message" 
- Finally, the name and the statement is taken from the user and it gets implemented in a **Chrome Browser** 🤙

## Tools Required

- Python installed on your computer 🖥
- Any IDE. In my case **PyCharm**
- Your valuable time 🌠
