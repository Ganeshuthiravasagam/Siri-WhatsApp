# Siri-WhatsApp

Automatic WhatsApp msg sender using siri 

For the romantic female voice of siri I have imported a python library **pyttsx3** - (Python text to speech)  

To recognize the voice input from us **speech_recognition** module is imported  

Finally to send the WhatsApp message **PyWhatKit** python library is imported

## How it works
