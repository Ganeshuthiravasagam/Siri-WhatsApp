# Siri-WhatsApp ðŸ‘©

Automatic WhatsApp msg sender using Siri 

For the romanticðŸ’ž female voice of Siri, I have imported a python library **pyttsx3** - (Python text to speech)  

To recognize the voice input from us(me)  **speech_recognition** module is introduced.   

Eventually to send the WhatsApp message **PyWhatKit** python library is initiated. 

## How it functions?

- Siri brings up herself and voluntarily asks for any support from her side.
- User - (Requests to send message to the person)
- Siri begins again her question "To whom you need to send the message"
- Finally, the name and the statement is taken from the user and it gets implemented in a **Chrome Browser**
